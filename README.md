# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which bundle together **data** (fields) and **behavior** (methods).  
Java is a primarily object-oriented language (except for primitive types), making OOP its core design principle.

## 🔑 Four Pillars of OOP in Java

### 1. Encapsulation  
Wrapping data (**variables**) and code (**methods**) into a single unit (**class**) with access control using modifiers like `private`, `public`, and `protected`.  

### 2. Inheritance  
A mechanism that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting **code reusability**.  

### 3. Polymorphism  
The ability of an object to take many forms. Implemented through:  
- **Method Overloading** (Compile-time polymorphism)  
- **Method Overriding** (Runtime polymorphism)  

### 4. Abstraction  
Hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

## 🚀 Why OOP in Java?
- Builds **modular**, **maintainable**, and **reusable** applications.  
- Makes it easier to model real-world entities like `Student`, `Car`, or `BankAccount`.  
- Helps organize large systems in a **clean, scalable** way.
